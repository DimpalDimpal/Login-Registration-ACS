# Advanced Cyber Security System

I've created the system with more security where,

1) Multiple users are allowed to login,
2) Password Encryption is used to encrypt the password before saving in the database,
3) Password strength is checked before registering the new user,
4) User can login either by using username or, email.
5) Google's reCAPTCHA v2 is used to verify if the user is human or bot. 

A simple Login System:

User can register an account easity just by filling the required information in the form.

User can reset their password, they will received a OTP send by PHPMailer to create their new password.

How to use this source code:

requirement:

1) install xampp
   here is the link to install xampp
   apachefriends.org/index.html

First step:

1) download this repo
2) create a folder name as ACS -> extract to your xampp folder -> htdocs -> on folder ACS copy and paste the file
3) go to phpmyadmin -> create database userregistration
4) copy all the query command from userregistration.sql -> paste it under the database loginsystem sql.
5) copy the path of index.php -> paste the link -> http://localhost:81/ACS/index.php
6) on the less secure on your email account which use to send out the email.
7) modify the account and password under the file -> UserDataController.php
8) now you are ready to run your Advance Cyber Security project !
9) Enjoy Coding!!!ðŸ˜€
